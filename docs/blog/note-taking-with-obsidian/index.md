The moment I switched to working for [Angi](https://www.angi.com/) I new that I needed to upgrade my note taking setup. For the last few years I had been using Bear and had been quite staisfied with it. However, the key feature Bear lacked was Vim mode. I believed that this caused me to use Bear less than I would normally.
