# Note taking with Obsidian

The moment I switched to working for [Angi](https://www.angi.com/) I knew that I needed to upgrade my note taking setup. For the last few years I had been using Bear and had been quite staisfied with it. However, the key feature Bear lacked was Vim mode. I believed that this caused me to use Bear less than I would normally. I was correct in that belief.

After 7 months at Angi, I can confidently say that I have written more now than anytime in  my career. Part of the reason, is my role at Angi requires a lot more written communication. For which, I always write my first draft in Obsidian before publishing it in Confluence or Google Docs. However, there is a bit of a chicken and egg situation because, I have also taken the initiative to write more because I no longer consider it tedious.

My current setup is to have a document for the whole week. In Obsidian there is a notion of daily notes, but I found that daily was too granular for me. My goal is to document at least 75% of work I did that day.
