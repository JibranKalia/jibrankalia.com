# Writing vs Reviewing Mode

I have started to realize that I have two different mindsets when I am writing code vs reviewing.

When I am in a writing mindset the goal is to get the code working and maybe improve it. I try to push the improvement details to later. This is especially true if I am working with a language that I can rely on an auto-formatter. At that point, I am just mashing the keyboard and relying on the formatter to fix it up for me.

However, then comes the time when I open a PR. And I look at it in GitHub / GitLab. At that point, my mindset switches to becoming more critical. I found that this true when its my MR our a teammates. Therefore, I have decided to lean into this for my own MRs. Where I go ahead and write a bunch of comments that I will come back later and fix it.
